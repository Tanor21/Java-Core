            Collection API :
            The Collection API (Application Programming Interface) in Java provides a set of interfaces and
            classes to represent and manipulate collections of objects. A collection, in this context,
            is a group of objects, known as elements, that are treated as a single unit.
            The Collection API is a part of the Java Collections Framework, which is a set of
            classes and interfaces introduced in Java to provide comprehensive and standardized support for handling collections of objects.

         NB :
         Collection API -> Collection, Map
         1 - Collection -> List, Queue, set
             - List -> ArrayList, LinkedList
             - Queue -> DeQueue
             - Set -> HashSet, LinkedHashSet
         2 - Map
